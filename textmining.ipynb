This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch.\n","\n","                    2,105 out of 2,401 found this helpful.\n","                        \n","                            Was this review helpful?

.much of it 's great .i feel like i love two of it three hour , and like the other hour .... but it 's that fact that stop me from ador the entir thing .i know with christoph nolan 's dunkirk , that click on a second watch , so mayb oppenheim will need one too .that be said , i do n't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon , becaus it wa a long and exhaust film.but in mani way , i ca n't deni it wa an except well made one .it look and sound as amaz as you 'd expect , feel as though it accur captur the time period it 's set in , and contain amaz sound design and one of the year 's best score so far .everi perform is good to great , but the film belong to cillian murphi , and i feel like he 's the lead actor to beat at thi stage , if we 're talk ( earli ) award consideration.th film 's at it best when it focus on be a psycholog thriller featur a famou histor figur , and at one point , it even turn into a psycholog horror film .there 's one sequenc in here involv a speech that 's particularli terrifi .it also manag to have some veri suspens moment , even though it stori is commonli known histori at thi point.i did realli feel the length in the final hour , though , and mayb i wish that final act had been more of an extend epilogu , rather than a whole third of the film .i current feel as though i would 've love oppenheim more had it been 2.5 hour instead of 3 , but noth about it wa bad by ani mean ; just a littl patienc test ( thi is veri subject - i rememb feel like the similarli long babylon total justifi it runtim , though other did n't feel that way ) .i 'm left feel like i watch a film that wa n't a slam dunk , but wa incred for more of it runtim than it wa n't .and that 's still worth celebr , and make oppenheim worth see in cinema for sure .10/10 a brilliantli layer examin of a man throughout all of hi incred accomplish and fundament flaw mrdhwong20 juli 2023 '' oppenheim '' is a biograph thriller film written and direct by christoph nolan ( `` the dark knight trilog '' , `` incept '' , `` interstellar '' , `` dunkirk '' ) , base on the biographi `` american prometheu '' by kai bird and martin j. sherwin .star cillian murphi in the lead role , in addit to matt damon , robert downey jr , emili blunt , and florenc pugh , it subvert the usual biopic formula to creat a brilliantli layer examin of a man throughout all of hi incred accomplish and fundament flaws.dur the height of the second world war , theoret physicist j. robert oppenheim ( cillian murphi ) is recruit by the unit state govern to overse the `` manhattan project '' , a top secret oper intend to develop the world 's first nuclear weapon .after becom acquaint with the project 's director major gener lesli grove ( matt damon ) , oppenheim and the gener come to an agreement that the best place to carri out such an undertak is the vast desert of lo alamo , new mexico .as numer other scientist and their famili are brought in to thi discreet locat , oppenheim work tirelessli around the clock to build thi weapon of mass destruct befor the nazi can devis their own .with the war rage and person troubl mount , oppenheim continu to push himself to hi utmost limit , but soon suffer the consequ of hi dedication.on august 6th , 1945 , the atom bomb `` littl boy '' wa drop on the japanes citi of hiroshima , make it the first time a nuclear weapon wa use in an act of war .the drop of thi bomb and `` fat man '' in nagasaki three day later wa what essenti brought an end to world war ii , and with it , began a frighten new era known as the `` atom age '' .to thi day , it remain a contenti topic of discuss among mani as to whether the ethic ramif of these bomb are justifi by what subsequ result from it .the one man whom most peopl pin all the blame on is j. robert oppenheim , whose key role in the develop of these weapon led to him be credit as `` the father of the atom bomb '' , a label which he carri as a heavi burden for the rest of hi life .in christoph nolan 's biopic `` oppenheim '' , we are treat to an intric structur and uniqu tragic analysi of thi complex man 's legaci and how it still affect everyon sever decad later.in true christoph nolan fashion , the stori is not told as a convent biopic but rather as a fragment , non-sequenti seri of highlight pertain to the titl subject 's life .when we are first introduc to j. robert oppenheim , we see that he is an incred intellig man whose sheer commit to hi craft earn him the utmost respect of mani of hi peer , even as a young student .howev , almost immedi after , the film cut to him on trial for allegedli have tie to commun , an accus which threaten to complet derail the posit reput bestow upon him .as the judici committe interrog him with hard hit question , oppenheim is haunt by the error of hi own judgement , shown to the audienc through flashback of vari length to pivot time in hi life .these scene rang from hi fractur relationship with hi wife to the remors he ha for place hi trust in the wrong peopl .thi give the viewer a first person perspect of what oppenheim 's mind must have been process dure thi intens period of hi life , as he contempl the veri real possibl of have all of hi hard work mitig by these power govern offici .it 's hard to imagin ani other director tri to convey so much inform to their audienc in such a fashion , but nolan manag to work hi magic in the best way possibl , alway strike the perfect balanc of showcas the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.anoth notabl thing about nolan 's direct is hi resourc in the way he handl certain import scene .one moment , which i wo n't speak about in too much detail , liter had me on the edg of my seat as we watch oppenheim and the rest of the scientist test out the prototyp bomb with each explos prove to be bigger than the last .sinc nolan ha been vocal about hi dislik of use cgi in hi film , he instead opt for more practic method of show the increas power of these bomb .by remind the audienc that the nazi could veri well be work on their own weapon of mass destruct , there is a real sens of urgenc flow throughout these scene , give the scientist all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemi at their own game .as each bomb explod , it can be liken to a tick clock , with each blast repres progress toward the end goal of perfect the ultim weapon .the creativ use of edit dure these scene keep thing move at a brisk pace , someth especi necessari consid the film 's three hour runtim .nolan previous exhibit a similar method in 2017 's `` dunkirk '' , which utilis the film 's score in a clever way to show the audienc how time is truli of the essenc .onc again , nolan ha found a clever way around take the easi rout of use cg effect to tell a stori , and keep viewer on their toe by use of good old fashion directori proficiency.for what can onli be describ as the perform of hi career , cillian murphi bring everyth necessari to the role of j. robert oppenheim , a man so complex that i ca n't imagin the amount of pressur there wa to play him thi effect .the combin effort of both murphi 's act and nolan 's direct help make oppenheim one of the most fascin individu of the 20th centuri .thi is not a man who can be view simpli at face valu , as there are so mani layer to hi charact that it bear an in-depth explor that onli a film like thi can accomplish .the film paint oppenheim as neither a hero nor a villain , but rather a complic man whose human qualiti undermin what he will be rememb for in the histori book .murphi approach him like that of a shakespearian figur , rife with flaw , haughti , and a sens of hubri that end up seal hi inevit fate .one scene may have you admir hi remark talent in the field of nuclear physic while anoth might caus you to hate him for hi unfaith to hi famili .he can be view simultan as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he help bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in histori , while consequ usher in someth even worse.th rest of the film 's cast all did a fantast job as well , with the standout be matt damon , robert downey jr , emili blunt , and florenc pugh .damon 's take on major gener lesli grove is more than simpli that of a stock militari charact but rather an import figur who seiz the opportun to use oppenheim 's talent to hi advantag .we watch as grove form an unlik allianc with the physicist , often question the ramif of the theoret natur in experi with nuclear power .grove 's ignor to oppenheim 's extens scientif knowledg allow the audienc to learn along with him when it is explain in basic detail .to that effect , he provid an import third parti perspect to oppenheim 's achievements.it 's also great to see robert downey jr shine as lewi strauss , which is not onli hi best post-mcu role but one of hi best role in gener .strauss is a man who is not view favour by histori due to hi role in expos oppenheim 's tie to commun .he hold such a grudg against oppenheim that you can practic consid him the true villain of thi stori .downey take everi opportun to show strauss 's two-fac natur , bide hi time for the right moment to strip oppenheim from the record book and damag hi reput .reportedli , downey consid thi hi best role to date , and it definit seem like he is put everyth he ha into hi performance.emili blunt and florenc pugh also contribut significantli as kitti oppenheim and jean tatlock , respect .each of these two women repres someth signific in oppenheim 's life , with kitti be who he should be with and jean be who he person want to be with .thi draw parallel to that of oppenheim choos between act on instinct or act on intellect when assist in the construct of the bomb , which again remind the audienc of hi flaw human qualiti .it can be difficult to give up follow your heart but when the fate of the world rest on your pragmat decis make , sometim you have no other choice.a a biopic and a christoph nolan film , `` oppenheim '' exce virtual all expect to becom one of the veri best in both field .there are few film that are abl to tackl such subject matter in thi much detail while also remain entertain the whole way through .i guess sometim all it take is one brave , risk-tak filmmak to prove that thi realli is a possibl task .we need more film like thi to inspir thought , creativ discuss and it is comfort to know that someon like nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream .after all , it 's a tough job , but someon 's got to do it for us.i rate it a perfect 10/10 .905 out of 1,140 found

''we 're just never shown whi .and thi is nolan 's chief sin - he is a teller , not a shower .a writer , not realli a director.tak `` a beauti mind '' for comparison .in that film , director ron howard regularli visual the work of john nash .he show him , for instanc , watch pigeon gather crumb , and in hi mind 's eye he map their pattern .or on a window overlay the view outsid of some young men play sport , he use a piec of white pastel to draw a diagram of them .film is a visual medium.consid `` schindler 's list '' ( or ani spielberg film , realli ) , and observ the block of the actor , the placement of the camera , all in servic of tell the stori visual .an actor may domin the frame , or mayb have hi back turn .charact may move and creat an entir new frame ( block ) .their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.in nolan 's filmmak , where the camera goe is realli arbitrari .and where he cut the shot ha to do with hi write , not the actor reaction or the block of the scene , so that the edit feel off , clunki , the shot move off of an actor at the start of a reaction , or come back with an actor alreadi in motion .thi is becaus nolan is cut for the script , reli on dialog to tell the entir stori .even play have blocking.tru , he decid to tell the stori of the `` father of the a-bomb '' chiefli through these two hear , the public one and the close one , so there 's go to be lot of talk .but then he doubl down on the talk - on the tell - even further .in one scene , casey affleck sit besid oppenheim in some room somewher ( i do n't even know who affleck wa play , realli , it wa veri short ) and while he 's talk to oppenheim , nolan cut back and forth to anoth scene with matt damon on a train with oppenheim , and damon is tell us about affleck and who he is and what he wants.charact should be reveal through action .not some other charact explain everyth off to the side.ther are a great mani cameo in nolan 's film - it is `` star stud . ''but rather than the appear of a name actor help to clarifi the charact portray , they distract .at one point , a woman near me in the theater said `` oh , look who that is , '' when remi malek appear .we 're focus on the actor and their previou role , not the character.everyth in thi film , especi the first nineti minut , bounc me off , like a stone skip over water .the scene are too short

be in the minor here when i say , i think christoph nolan miss the mark with thi film .let 's first talk about what work : `` oppenheim '' is no doubt a treat for the ear and eye .i watch it in imax 70mm , the crisp of detail in the 70mm film stock wa superb , and the 5.1 dts-hd master audio surround sound wa impact , sometim even shake the seat .the act wa outstand and there are some realli memor moment and tens scene between actor .i also do n't think i need to say anyth further about nolan as a filmmak ; he 's like martin scorses in the way you know exactli what you 're go to get from a nolan film , in term of style and tone.now onto the problem : nolan 's film tend to be veri dialogue-heavi , and thi film wa no differ .have not done ani earlier research on oppenheim 's life purpos , so i can go into the film with a blank slate and let nolan do the work for me , i felt disappoint that i had to look up peopl 's name and backstori dure the film .nolan throw you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposit or background of each real histor figur portray .normal i do n't like a lot of exposit , but for a 3-hour long film , it would be great if we could fill in the blank for some of the real-lif figur ' motiv and aspir , to get a better feel on whi they either support or deni help oppenheim on the manhattan project.mi other major gripe wa the absenc of ani real emot arch .the film is somewhat of a straightforward retel of event , no better than watch a three-hour documentari about oppenheim 's work on the manhattan project , but without extens exposit as mention earlier .ye , it 's edit in a non-linear fashion , but if one were to re-edit the film chronolog , you 'd get a straightforward and somewhat dri narr .one of the goal of a filmmak is to help you empath with the charact , especi the protagonist .although nolan perhap want us to feel ambival about oppenheim 's ambigu moral , it still would have been nice to get a littl bit of a better perspect as to whi oppenheim decid to move forward with the manhattan project beyond the obviou reason of want recognit as a premier theoret physicist.thi is also true for moment in the film that i wish were includ that would have left more of a last impact on the audienc if ad in .the actual drop of both bomb in hiroshima and nagasaki are not includ , mere mention over a radio broadcast .so in my opinion the emot weight of the drop of those two bomb , and wit the sheer horror of their impact is total lost on the audienc beyond oppenheim 's wake nightmar that he ha throughout the film .for film of thi statur , sometim i imagin scenic moment in my head befor watch the film , which can taint the experi if you have these type of high expect for potenti emot impact scene .i tri not to let it dampen my experi , but onc i realiz these moment were not includ in the film , i felt that there wa much more left to the imagination.lastli , the sound design wa much better than `` interstellar '' or nolan 's previou film where the score overpow the dialogu .i could hear the dialogu in `` oppenheim '' for most of the film , but there were still a hand of time when i could n't hear peopl speak over the orchestr score .that 's not to say it hold the film back in ani substant way , i just want to mention it still seem to be a minor issu in nolan 's filmography.thi film will no doubt be regard as a classic , and in the nolan pantheon , it will most like rank amongst `` the prestig '' , `` the dark knight '' , `` incept '' and `` interstellar '' , as some of nolan 's greatest work .but i ca n't help but feel like nolan is also a bit on autopilot , in term of hi filmmak prowess .much like p. t. anderson with `` licoric pizza '' , and we anderson for `` astroid citi '' , these power filmmak have found their sweet spot and are stick to it .nolan i feel is lean into hi strength as well with `` oppenheim '' , but in my opinion , is no longer challeng himself as a filmmak .thi is not necessarili a bad thing ; he is one of our best live director .but as a fan of steven spielberg , stanley kubrick , david lynch , and ridley scott who are versatil director that can tackl differ genr and tone , i feel nolan will stick to hi gun ( and , well , explos ) , and keep give us intellig charact studi , that unfortun occasion lack in catharsi or heighten emot depth .308 out of 392 found
